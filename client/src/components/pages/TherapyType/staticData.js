    title: 'Psychodynamic Psychotherapy',
    text: `psychodynamic psychotherapy draws on theories and practices of analytical psychology
  and psychoanalysis. It is a therapeutic process which helps patients understand and
  resolve their problems by increasing awareness of their inner world and its influence
  over relationships both past and present. It differs from most other therapies in aiming
  for deep seated change in personality and emotional development.
  Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy aim to help people with serious
  psychological disorders to understand and change complex, deep-seated and often
  unconsciously based emotional and relationship problems thereby reducing symptoms
  and alleviating distress. However, their role is not limited only to those with mental
  health problems. Many people who experience a loss of meaning in their lives or who
  are seeking a greater sense of fulfilment may be helped by psychoanalytic or
  psychodynamic psychotherapy.
  The relationship with the therapist is a crucial element in the therapy. The therapist
  offers a confidential and private setting which facilitates a process where unconscious
  patterns of the patient's inner world become reflected in the patient's relationship with
  the therapist (transference). This process helps patients gradually to identify these
  patterns and, in becoming conscious of them, to develop the capacity to understand
  and change them.`,
