    title: 'Cognitive Behavioural Therapy',
    text: `Problem solving to manage difficulties - 
    CBT is a type of therapy that puts the emphasis on the therapist and the client working together
    to address present difficulties using certain strategies and rational thinking.
    A CBT therapist is trained in offering clients tools to reduce the impact of mental health
    symptoms and try active strategies, such as changes in behaviour or guided problem solving to
    reduce depression and anxiety.
    CBT does not address interpersonal issues in relationships and does not aim to change the
    unconscious factors influencing an individual’s distress. It requires a commitment from the client
    to participate actively by undertaking certain exercises and putting advice and strategies into
    practice.
    A course of CBT therapy typically lasts between 1 and 6 months.`,

    title: 'Psychodynamic Psychotherapy',
    text: `
    Discovering and transforming unconscious patterns in the psyche - 
    Psychodynamic psychotherapy aims at understanding and transforming unconscious or deep
    seated involuntary patterns in a client’s thinking and relationships, and in his or her general
    attitude towards life’s challenges.
    One may want to undertake this kind of treatment when there is a sense of
    dissatisfaction/frustration in one or more aspects of one’s relationships, or dissatisfaction with
    an important area of one’s life without knowing exactly how to change it.
    A psychodynamic psychotherapist will guide the individual in their understanding of some
    patterns in relating to themselves or others that the client has without knowing. The therapist
    would guide the client in becoming aware of their origin and the way these patterns are active in
    their present relationships, including their relationship with their therapist.
    This therapy requires a commitment to understand and transform deeper aspects of one’s
    personality and a sense of curiosity towards one’s own psychological functioning. Sessions can
    be once or twice a week. A course of psychodynamic psychotherapy typically lasts between 1
    and 3 years, during which a significant change in the client’s awareness, interpersonal
    experience and sometimes even personality is achieved.`,

    title: 'Humanistic Psychotherapy',
    text: `Seeing every individual as a whole, offering unconditional support - 
    The main concept behind humanistic approaches to psychotherapy is an unconditional, positive
    regard for the client as an individual with his or her own potential for self realisation.
    
    In humanistic psychotherapies the therapeutic relationship provides a supportive environment
    for each individual to become more aware of themselves and able to make informed and helpful
    decisions in their life and relationships.
    A humanistic psychotherapy will provide warmth and acceptance toward the client’s
    predicament, to help them to accept themselves as a whole, and to reach an increased sense of
    integrity and autonomy. Gestalt and Client Centered are the two main modalities of humanistic
    psychotherapy (please see the glossary for more details).
    The typical length of humanistic psychotherapy varies between six months and several years.`,

    title: 'Integrative Psychotherapy',
    text: `An eclectic approach to finding more awareness and happiness - 
    Integrative psychotherapy uses a variety of techniques taken from a variety of theories,
    including psychodynamic, interpersonal, cognitive, behavioural and body psychotherapy to offer
    a flexible approach to a client’s specific needs.
    The aims are to increase the client’s self-awareness by integrating unwanted parts of the self
    that are causing distress and internal or interpersonal conflict.
    There will be an emphasis on flexibility and adaptability of the therapy to the specific needs of
    the client, with the theoretical underpinnings being less rigorous and more eclectic than those of
    psychodynamic psychotherapy,
    A course of integrative psychotherapy typically lasts between six months and a few years.`,

    title: 'Counselling',
    text: `A safe listening space to overcome a difficult time -
    Counselling provides a safe space where a client can be listened sympathetically, and given
    advice and coping strategies to manage emotional distress.
    Unlike psychotherapy, counselling does not aim to address deep seated psychological
    problems, and can be a good choice when a client who otherwise is happy with their identity
    and/or relationships, and is undergoing a difficult time in relation to a painful life event that is
    particularly challenging and overwhelming.
    A counsellor’s work is also influenced by three main theoretical currents: psychodynamic,
    integrative or humanistic.
    Counselling can consist of just one or two sessions, or can last longer and become akin to
    psychotherapy if the counsellor and the client deepen their relationship, and the client
    becomesinterested in achieving a substantial psychological change.`,

    title: 'Brief Psychodynamic Psychotherapy',
    text: `Focussed, intensive work on unconscious patterns in relationships - 
    This kind of therapy is similar in aim and technique to traditional psychodynamic psychotherapy,
    however it is more limited in its scope and length.
    Suitable for those who wish to work with depth and rigour on one specific unconscious aspect of
    their behaviour and relationships without having to commit to years of therapy.
    The client is required to commit to working in a focussed manner, to achieve a significant
    change in their awareness in a relatively short time.
    The average length of brief psychodynamic psychotherapies varies between 3 and 6 months.`,
